        <h1>Solex Swag</h1>

        Several of the nicest people in the world (Solex users) have suggested I put up a page to take donations for Solex.
        That's pretty cool, so I did that for a week. But I bet it's cooler to get something in return, so I'm switching 
        to that approach. (I think they call that a "pivot" in the startup world.)

        <p>
        Anyway, here's a basic swag page, hand-crafted by someone selling Solex swag.
        </p>

        <h2>Solex Lanyard</h2>
        This is a 3/4" nylon lanyard with a carabiner on the end, and a breakaway piece so you don't hang yourself. Price is
        <b>$14</b>, and shipping is <b>free!</b> No idea what the text field below is for, I guess you could put in a quantity.

        <p>
        <b>NOTE:</b>
        International shipping turns out to be quite a chunk of money. So, if you're in some country other than the US, 
        there's another button below for ordering. Additional shipping is <b>$11</b>. 
        This additional cost is calculated to be the average of what I've seen so far. $25 seems like a lot for a lanyard, but 
        apparently those little mail trucks burn a lot of fuel when they cross the ocean.
